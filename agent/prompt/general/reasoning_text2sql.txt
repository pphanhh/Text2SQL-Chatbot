Here is a natural language query that you need to convert into a SQL query:

<task>

{task}

</task>

### Company details

<data>

{stock_code_table}

</data>

### Snapshot of the mapping table:
<data>

{suggestions_table}

</data>

### Here are some examples of a query that you can refer to:

<example>

{few_shot}

</example>
 
<instruction>

Analyze the task step-by-step then return SQL query that match with the database schema.

If possible, the table result should have the following columns:

- stock_code / industry
- year
- quarter
- category_code / stock_code
- data / data_mean / data_sum

However, feel free to modify the table if needed.

</instruction>

### Note: 
- Include the detailed suitable name (including datetime, industry, ...) for the table in the query in the following format:

```sql
-- ### detailed_table_name
```

- The `category_code` mapping table contain value of both `financial_statment` and `explaination` tables
- The user can only see the query results, so your name should be as informative as possible.
- Do not make any assumption about the account name. You can refer to the mapping table above to find the suitable account.
- The query must not contain column `ratio_name` or `en_caption`.
- If the question requires data within the quarter time range (from 2020 to Q3 2024), you should use the `date_added` instead of `year` and `quarter`, in the following format:

```sql
WHERE date_added BETWEEN '2020-01-01' AND '2024-09-30' 
AND quarter !=0

-- Date added for each quarter:
-- - Q1: YYYY-03-30
-- - Q2: YYYY-06-30
-- - Q3: YYYY-09-30
-- - Q4: YYYY-12-30
-- - Q0: YYYY-12-30 (Annual data is add at the end of the year)
```

- If the question requires data within annual data, you can use `year` column directly
