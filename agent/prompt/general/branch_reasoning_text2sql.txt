You have the following database schema:

<description>

{database_description}

</description>

Here is a natural language query that you need to convert into a query:

<query>

{task}

</query>    

Note:
- You must get the financial ratio data in `financial_ratio` table.
- Your SQL query must only access the database schema provided.
- In each step, you should only do the task that is required. Do not do the task of next step.
- Make the SQL query as simple and readable as possible. Utilize existing data from previous steps to avoid unnecessary query.
- You are penalized if generating wrong or meaningless SQL query 
- If the data provided is enough to answer the question, you don't have to return SQL query.
        
Here are the steps to break down the task:

<steps>

{steps_string}

</steps>      

Snapshot of the mapping table:

<data>

{suggestions_table}

</data>

### Note: 
- Include the detailed suitable name (including datetime, industry, ...) for the table in the query in the following format:
    ```sql

    -- ### detailed_table_name

    ```
- The user can only see the sql results, so your name should be as informative as possible
- If the time is not mentioned, assume getting the current time (Q3 2024)
- Do not make any assumption about the column name. You can refer to the mapping table above to find the suitable column name.
