### Note on schema description: 
- Each value in `category_code` includes a prefix indicating the report it pertains to: *BS* is Balance sheet, *IS* is for Income statement, *CF* is Cash flow and *TM* is for Explaination.
- For `category_code` in `financial_statement_explaination`, there are 4 additional prefix: *Crop*, *Bank*, *Sec* and *Share* for specific type of organization.
- With YoY ratio in `financial_ratio`, you should recalculate the ratio if the time window is not 1 year.

### Note on creating query:
- You will be provided a mapping table with caption for `category_code` and `ratio_code`, and you are only allow to use that reference to select suitable code.
- For any financial ratio, it must be selected from the database rather than being calculated manually.
- If two rows share a similar meaning, using a rounded code.
- Always include a `quarter` condition in your query. If not specified, assume using annual reports, with the query defaulting to `quarter` = 0.
- Always include a LIMIT clause in your query.
