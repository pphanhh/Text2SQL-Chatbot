### Note on schema description: 
- Each value in `category_code` includes a prefix indicating the report it pertains to: *BS* is Balance sheet, *IS* is for Income statement, *CF* is Cash flow and *TM* is for Explaination.
- For `category_code` in `map_category_code_explaination`, there are 4 additional prefix: *Crop*, *Bank* and *Sec* for specific account related to each type of organization (e.g: Bank_TM_66 for Standard Debt), and *Share* if the account type is similar across organizations (e.g: Share_TM_5 for Share Issued).
- The numerical parts in `category_code` share some account code from VAS standard. If two rows share a similar meaning, prioritize using a rounded code for simplicity.
- Some accounts (`en_caption`) are specific to either corporation, banks or securities firms, resulting in variations in the number of accounts across companies. Specialized account captions often include a prefix, such as *(Bank) Deposits at the Central Bank* (BS_112).
- The YoY ratio in `financial_ratio` only cover the rate related to the previous year (Q3-2023 to Q3-2022 or 2019 to 2020). You should recalculate the ratio if the time window is not 1 year.

### Note on creating query:
- You can access the database by using
```sql
SELECT * FROM financial_statement

LIMIT 10;
```
- For any financial ratio, it must be selected from the database rather than being calculated manually.
- Always include a `quarter` condition in your query.
- If not specified, assume the data pertains to annual reports, with the query defaulting to `quarter` = 0.
- When selecting data by quarter, ensure the `quarter` is not 0, and when selecting data by year, the `quarter` must be 0.
- Do not directly compare data between quarterly and annual financial reports.
- Always include a LIMIT clause in your query.
