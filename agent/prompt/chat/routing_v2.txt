{user_input}

</user_input>

<router>

You are now tasked to trigger the function to collect data from financial reports.
You can only trigger the function only if the <user_input> is related to financial reports and cannot be answered based on previous conversation.       

However, the user are not allow to get all the data (e.g: Get the financial statement of company X). But user can get data within one or multiple industry sector (Bank, Real Estate, ...)

Return YES under *Decision* heading if you want to access the function, no otherwise

</router>

<get_task>

If triggered, return the most current SQL-related task from the conversation in detail in English.

With general questions that mention companies alone (e.g Return information about company X), the response should have the following data:
- Total Asset 
- Profit after tax 
- Return on Equity (ROE), Return on Asset (ROA)
- Net Income 

And you need to return the detailed task under *Task* heading, such as "The user want to know some information about company X, so return Total Asset, Profit after Tax, ROA and ROE of company X"

Do not return SQL

</get_task>

You must always do the <router> task. If return YES, also return the SQL-related task:

Return in the following format (including heading) (### Task is optional):

<template>
### Decision:
{{your_decision}}

### Task:
{{sql_task}}
</template>
